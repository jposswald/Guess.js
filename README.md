# Guess.js
A small game based on hasbro's Mastermind. Coded entirely on Node.js

Welcome to Guess!
The goal is to guess a random generated 4 digits number, with numbers from 1 to 6, in less than 10 turns.
Guesses get a reply consisting of:
Green Xs, one for each Correct number in a correct place.
Blue Xs, one for each Correct number but in a wrong place.
White Xs, one for each number that's not in the solution.
Note that the reply will always be first green, then blue, and then white.

If you decide to give up or you can't wait to see the answer, you can simply type: 'solve', or 'help'.
